# Serotonin (5-HT)

:man: - Information is related for humans 

:rat: - Information is related for rats 

Experiments with the local injection of 5-HT inhibitors in the raphé nuclei **support an inhibitory role** of the raphé nuclei in motivational behavior.

**The role of 5-HT in reward is complicated** by the fact that it binds to a large number of receptor types that have different effects on reward-oriented behavior ([PierreHornung, 2003]).

The localization of TPH-IR neurons in every eighth section of the series has been plotted in reference to the outline of the brainstem. The distribution of the TPH-IR neurons in each raphe nucleus is illustrated separately in individual panels. Notice that the rostral group of the raphe neurons (left panels) is spatially segregated from the caudal group mostly restricted to the medulla (right panels). The rostro-caudal length of the recontructed brainstem is 62 mm 
([Hornung, 2012]).

## :rat: Neurons

DRN serotonergic neurons were identified by established criteria, which include wide-duration action potentials between 1–2 ms, positive-negative spikes, a regular rhythm and a slow firing rate (0.5–3 Hz). Burst-firing DRN serotonergic neurons were identified as described previously, by criteria including fired spike doublets or triplets with an intraburst time-interval fewer than 20 ms ([Miguelez, et al., 2010]).

### :rat: Neuron number

In DRN **8711 neurons** ([Aldahmash, 2010]). 

In MRN **1064 neurons** ([Aldahmash, 2010]). 

As mentioned earlier **the total number** of the serotonergic neurons is really small. In Rats the number of neurons is around **20,000** ([Wiki Neuronbank]).

The **number of serotonergic neurons** in DR is larger than in MR,
although it is not established how that is represented in the absolute
number or differential distribution of inputs ([Iskra et al., 2014]).

## Detalized connectivity

## 1. The Rostral Group

The rostral group is composed of the CLi, the **DR**, the **MnR**, and the pontomesencephalic neuron ([Hornung, 2012]).

### Efferent Projections (Output)

Efferent projections from the rostral serotonergic group ascend in two parallel pathways. 


#### A ventral pathway
A ventral pathway starting at the level of the trochlear nucleus runs lateral of the MnR and reaches the mesencephalic ventral tegmental area near the dorsal limits of the interpeduncular nucleus.  More rostrally, the ventral pathway extends into the medial forebrain bundle reaching the basal forebrain and the medial cortex. 

The dorsal and the median raphe nuclei have distinct and partially overlapping projections, which will be considered separately. The ascending serotonergic projections to the cerebral cortex are described separately.

**DRN** (The rostral division) projects principally to:

- cerebral cortex
- neostriatum
- amygdala
- lateral septum
- substantia nigra

**DRN** (The caudal division) projects to the: 

- hippocampus
- entorhinal cortex
- locus coeruleus

The **DRN** projects also to the thalamus


The main projections from **MnR** (the midline division) are directed to the: 
- basal forebrain
- the septal region
- hippocampus

The **MnR** also innervates the cerebral cortex. 

**MnR** (The dorsal region) projects predominantly to the: 

- amygdala. 

**MnR** (The lateral division) in the PnO projects to more caudal structures than the midline division of MnR. There are *serotonergic* connections with the *dopaminergic* neurons of the:

- substantia nigra
- the intralaminar nucleus of the thalamus
- mammillary nuclei

Thus, **MnR** projections could modulate both:

- the striatal system via its projections to the SN and the intralaminar nucleus of the thalamus, 

- the hippocampus via direct projections and indirect projections via the septal and mammillary nuclei


To summarize, axons originating in DR bear small varicosities (less
than 1 mm in diameter), are widely distributed in the neocortex and hippocampus

In contrast, axons originating in MnR bear large varicosities distributed predominantly in the hippocampus and in certain neocortical areas

#### 0. Projections to the Hippocampus

The **MnR** projection **to the hippocampus** has been extensively studied with tract-tracing and immunocytochemical techniques in rodents and non-human primates. In rodents, this projection selectively innervates populations of GABAergic interneurons, with numerous large axonal varicosities forming conventional synapses. 

> Similar connections have been observed in the primate hippocampus.

 Through this pathway, raphe neurons indirectly **inhibit the activity of the pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus via a synaptic excitation of hippocampal GABAergic interneurons** mediated by serotonergic 5-HT3 receptors


#### 1. Projections to the SNc and VTA
Electron microscopy studies have shown that 5-HT neurons make direct synaptic contacts with dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic neurons in the VTA, indicating the direct and indirect influence of the raphé nuclei on the midbrain dopamine system. Electrical stimulation of the MRN **inhibits** the majority of (but not all) **the activity of dopamine neurons** ([PierreHornung, 2003]).

As 5-HT2C receptors are mainly localized in GABAergic neurons in the SNr and VTA, which in turn inhibit dopamine neurons, the inhibitory effect of a 5-HT2C agonist on dopamine function is, at least in part, due to the GABA-mediated tonic inhibitory effect of 5-HT on mesolimbic and nigrostriatal dopamine function. 
> On the other hand, the activation of VTA 5-HT1B receptors increases mesolimbic dopamine release, probably by inhibiting GABA release ([PierreHornung, 2003]).


#### 2. Projection to SNr

The functional significance of 5-HT in the SNr, however, **is not well understood**.

> The SNr is one of the major targets of the DRN in rats, cats, and monkeys. In monkeys, 5-HT innervations are particularly dense in the SNr, but much less so in the SNc (Lavoie and Parent, 1990). Coexpression of 5-HT2C receptor mRNA with glutamic acid decarboxylase, but not with tyrosine hydroxylase mRNA, indicates that 5-HT2C receptors are restricted to GABAergic neurons. The functional significance of 5-HT in the SNr, however, is not well understood ([PierreHornung, 2003]).


#### 3. Projections to the amygdala

Several nuclei of the amygdala receive rich serotonergic innervations. In rats, the rostral and medial subregions are dense projection sites of 5-HT neurons. The effect of DRN on neurons in the amygdala **is reportedly inhibitory** and mediated by direct DRN-amygdala serotonergic projections ([PierreHornung, 2003]).


#### 4. Projections to the hypothalamus

The hypothalamus plays a significant role in the processing of natural rewards, such as food and sex, and it receives strong inputs from the DRN. Extracellular 5-HT levels increased in the medial and lateral hypothalamus during the anticipation and intake of food, but not after its consumption. Interestingly, this finding **was interpreted in line with the reward-inhibiting and satiety-facilitating functions of 5-HT in the hypothalamus** ([PierreHornung, 2003]).


#### 5. Projections to the cortex

The DRN also projects to virtually all cortical areas, and **its effect can be excitatory and inhibitory, depending on which layers it projects to and the presence of different receptor types**. Electrical stimulation of the DRN and MRN inhibits the majority of medial prefrontal cortex neurons via 5-HT1A or 5-HT2 receptors. Among several receptor types, 5-HT2A receptors are particularly dense in the prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortices, and they are primarily located on the apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons. Prefrontal 5-HT2A receptors may activate cortico-tegmental projection neurons, which in turn facilitate VTA dopamine neurons. On the other hand, *5-HT2A/2C receptors* are also present in the GABAergic interneurons of the cortex and **may regulate glutamatergic output**. 5-HT2C activation in the medial frontal cortex suppresses cocaine-seeking behavior ([PierreHornung, 2003]).


## Afferent Projections

A large number of afferents **are common to the DR and MnR**. The major source of afferents to DR and MnR is the lateral habenula, a pathway using excitatory amino acids


Several hypothalamic projections to the DR and MnR originate from nuclei in the medial and lateral preoptic areas, and the lateral, dorsal, and posterior divisions of the hypothalamus.  There is an abundant GABAergic innervation of DR neurons, some of which are of hypothalamic origin


 Medial prefrontal cortex innervates the DR and MnR nuclei (Celada et al., 2001; Vazquez-Borsetti et al., 2010), and stimulation of this pathway generates inhibition of the serotonergic (bursting) neurons in the midbrain


The central nucleus of the amygdala projects to the DRV and DRD (Peyron et al., 1998; Lee et al., 2007) Ascending projections to MnR originated from the RMg and RPa nuclei and from the nucleus prepositus hypoglossi (Behzadi et al., 1990). A serotonergic innervation in the brainstem is mediated by 5-HT1A serotonergic, GABAergic, and glutamatergic neurons widely distributed in the rostral brainstem, but not in cholinergic neurons

#### 1. Inputs from Hypothalamus

Hypothalamic nuclei are critical for homeostatic regulation of basic physiological processes including food intake, body temperature, and sleep-wake cycles. Hypothalamic subdivisions, such as LHA, have been implicated in sleep regulation through interaction with the serotonin system including projections to the DR ([Iskra et al., 2014]).

#### 2. Inputs from Amygdala

Conventional retrograde tracing studies have determined that projections from amygdala to DR originate primarily from the central nucleus (CEA), with limited inputs from the other amygdala nuclei ([Iskra et al., 2014]).

#### 3. Inputs from Thalamus

Projections from DR preferentially target thalamic nuclei that are important for cognitive or emotional behaviors, in particular anterior nuclei, mediodorsal nucleus, and the midline and intralaminar nuclei, while avoiding principal nuclei. The thalamus itself is considered to have limited projections to DR and **only from midline thalamus (paraventricular and paratenial nuclei)** ([Iskra et al., 2014]).

#### 4. Direct Prefrontal Cortex Inputs to Serotonergic Neurons

Several PFC regions have projections to DR, although the circuit organization or functional relevance of these pathways has not been established. Tracing of PFC inputs to the DR region using conventional retrograde approaches **have reported contradicting results** concerning the anatomical distribution
and density of input neurons ([Iskra et al., 2014]).

#### 5. Basal Ganglia Circuits Control Serotonergic Neurons

 Basal ganglia circuits **receive dense serotonergic inputs**. We identified a large number of EGFP-labeled neurons in several basal ganglia circuits, including STR, globus pallidus (GPe), and substantia nigra (SN). 

##### VTA/SNc
Projections **from VTA and SNc to DR** are considered to be mainly nondopaminergic, **representing a GABAergic population**, although dopaminergic terminals are found in DR. In agreement with our findings, the VTA contains **a major GABAergic population** that is considered to project to the DR region, probably corresponding to the EGFP-expressing nondopaminergic cells we have identified. 

##### SNr
Interestingly, we also identified a large number of EGFP-labeled neurons in SNr, **the major output nucleus of the basal ganglia**. The SNr has been found to primarily target specific thalamic nuclei but there are also nonthalamic projections described, which are thought to target the superior colliculus (SC) and the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN). 

##### GPe
The external segment of globus pallidus receives inputs from SN and striatum as well as from serotonergic neurons. We identified EGFP-labeled neurons in GPe along the whole rostrocaudal axis and distribution of labeled neurons was not restricted to the caudal pole of GPe, an area previously described to project to PAG. 

##### Striatum
The striatum (caudoputamen (CP) and nucleus accumbens (NAc)) receives a wide serotonergic innervation, but it is not known whether striatal projection neurons could also provide a reciprocal input to serotonergic neurons. We found that most EGFP-labeled striatal neurons were negative for Penk (Figure 7E; 73.7% ± 20.6% EGFP-labeled neurons were Penk-negative, mean ± SD, n = 56 neurons, n = 3 mice), suggesting that D1-expressing MSNs constitute the major striatal input to serotonergic neurons. However, we could also demonstrate the presence of a subpopulation of EGFP-labeled MSNs that were positive for Penk, indicating the existence of two parallel striatal projection pathways with monosynaptic inputs onto serotonergic neurons, pointing to the complexity of these circuits. Photostimulation of ChR2-positive axon terminals originating from D1-expressing striatal neurons resulted in strong synaptic responses in serotonergic neurons. The light-induced synaptic responses were blocked by a GABA-A receptor antagonist, **demonstrating a direct GABAergic connection**. 

In summary, we have identified a striatal projection pathway that monosynaptically controls serotonergic neurons in DR. This hyperdirect ventral striatal pathway can potentially represent a critical inhibitory feedback pathway onto serotonergic neurons. As a whole, our data reveal an unexpected diversity of parallel hyperdirect pathways from basal ganglia circuits that directly target serotonergic neurons, including pathways from distinct populations of the striatum, GPe, VTA, SNr, and SNc, as well as dopaminergic neurons located in the VTA/SNc region ([Iskra et al., 2014]).






#### :x: 1.2 A dorsal pathway
A dorsal pathway running at the ventral side of the medial longitudinal fasciculus collects projections from DR and the dorsolateral cluster of MnR. The dorsal pathway enters the internal capsule, heading for the lateral cerebral cortex. 

The projections of the dorsal raphe could be subdivided according to the rostral (B7; DRD, DRV, DRVL, and DRI) and caudal (B6; DRC) divisions of this nucleus on either part of the rhombencephalic isthmus.

MnR (dorsolateral cluster) ➞ . . .
DR (ventral side of the medial longitudinal fasciculus) ➞ . . .

**A dorsal pathway is not interesting for us because of unusing pathway's target brain parts in our model**



#### Difference between DR and MR
Overall, the pattern of inputs targeting DR versus MR serotonergic neurons is similar on a gross anatomical level, although we find preferential distribution in anatomical subdivisions.



## :x: 2. The Caudal Group

The caudal group is composed of the RMg, the ROb, and the RPa. The group of serotonergic neurons in the medulla extends laterally from RMg in the Gia, the lateral paragigantocellular reticular nucleus (LPGi), and the lateral reticular nucleus.

**Not implemented, because of ?????**
